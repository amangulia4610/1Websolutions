🚀 1 Web Solutions – Full Website Redesign & Performance Boost

Hey there! 👋
Welcome to the complete source for the redesigned website of 1 Web Solutions, a full-service digital agency. This project was a massive overhaul of our online presence — not just the homepage, but the entire site — with a sharp focus on performance, animations, and responsive design.

🎯 Project Overview

I undertook this project to give 1 Web Solutions a sleek, modern, and high-performing website. The goal was to transform it into a visually engaging and technically advanced experience — something you'd expect from award-winning digital studios.

But here's the kicker:
The landing page alone had 150+ images and custom fonts. Despite that, using advanced optimization techniques, I achieved a Google Lighthouse performance score of 99/100! ⚡️

🌟 What Makes It Stand Out?

I've employed a range of cutting-edge tools and techniques, including:

HTML5 / CSS3 / JavaScript (ES6+)
GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) for rich animations
ScrollTrigger for scroll-based effects
Locomotive Scroll for buttery-smooth scrolling
3D mouse-hover tilt effects
Image optimization, minification, obfuscation, and resource prioritization
The result?
✨ A fully responsive, fast-loading, and elegant website with scroll-triggered animations, hover-based interactions, and smooth transitions that deliver a premium user experience across all devices.
