# 🚀 **1 Web Solutions – Full Website Redesign & Performance Boost**

Hey there! 👋  
Welcome to the complete source for the redesigned website of **1 Web Solutions**, a full-service digital agency. This project was a massive overhaul of our online presence — not just the homepage, but the entire site — with a sharp focus on **performance, animations, and responsive design**.

---

## 🎯 **Project Overview**

I undertook this project to give 1 Web Solutions a **sleek, modern, and high-performing** website. The goal was to transform it into a **visually engaging** and **technically advanced** experience — something you'd expect from award-winning digital studios.

But here's the kicker:  
The landing page alone had **150+ images** and **custom fonts**. Despite that, using advanced optimization techniques, I achieved a **Google Lighthouse performance score of 99/100!** ⚡️

## 🌟 **What Makes It Stand Out?**

I've employed a range of **cutting-edge tools and techniques**, including:

- **HTML5 / CSS3 / JavaScript (ES6+)**
- **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)** for rich animations
- **ScrollTrigger** for scroll-based effects
- **Locomotive Scroll** for buttery-smooth scrolling
- **3D mouse-hover tilt effects**
- **Image optimization, minification, obfuscation**, and **resource prioritization**

**The result?**  
✨ A fully responsive, fast-loading, and elegant website with **scroll-triggered animations**, **hover-based interactions**, and **smooth transitions** that deliver a **premium user experience** across all devices.
